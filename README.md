# BEVDetection Explorer

This repository is intended to explore awesome vision-only 3D BEV detection projects and re-implement them with the other attractive features/components (e.g., SOTA backbones).

## Supported Detectors
Current list of supported BEV detectors is based on the [Lift-Splat-Shoot](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/lift-splat-shoot) [[ECCV 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05711)]. Our plan is to add Transformer-based detectors such as [BEVFormer](https://github.com/fundamentalvision/BEVFormer) [[ECCV 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17270)].

- [BEVDet](https://github.com/HuangJunJie2017/BEVDet) [[arXiv 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11790)]
- [BEVDepth](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/BEVDepth) [[AAAI 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05649)]

Detectors focusing on **temporal fusion**, such as [SOLOFusion](https://github.com/Divadi/SOLOFusion) and [BEVDet4D](https://github.com/HuangJunJie2017/BEVDet), will also be added soon.
